# Hello plu-ts

We'll write and interact with our first smart contract in this example project using the [CIP-0030](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) standard.

The final version of this project is available [here](https://github.com/michele-nuzzi/hello-pluts-react-final), and you can test it out in the [live demo](https://hello-pluts.harmoniclabs.tech/).

:::note the old version of this example project

If you are looking for the old version of this example project, you can [click here](./Hello_world_v0) to check it out.

We would also highlight the [useful run trough of the old example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6MaSz6NIh8&themeRefresh=1) created by our community members

:::

## Pre-requisites

All we need to build a dApp is:

- `plu-ts`
- some way to submit transactions.
- react + [`MeshSDK`](https://meshjs.dev/)

In fact, `plu-ts` allows you to write the smart contract and create transactions.

To submit the transaction, we will use [`koios-pluts`](../tools/koios-pluts), a wrapper on top of the [koios](https://www.koios.rest/) API that uses `plu-ts` off-chain types;
but we'll think about that later.

So for now, our pre-requisites add up to:

- `plu-ts` (and `npm` to install it)
- anything that can run javascript (server environment or browser, it doesn't matter)
- an internet connection

## Project set up

using `git` we clone the initial `hello-pluts-react` project form [github](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/hello-pluts-react):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/hello-pluts-react.git
cd hello-pluts-react
git remote remove origin
```

This gives us the following project structure:

```
./hello-pluts-react
├── contracts
│   └── helloPluts.ts
├── next.config.js
├── next-env.d.ts
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json

│   │   └── index.tsx
│   └── styles
│       ├── globals.css
│       └── Home.module.css
└── tsconfig.json
```

The project comes with all the dependencies we need;

The most important ones are:

```json title="package.json"
"dependencies": {
    "@harmoniclabs/plu-ts": "^0.3.0",
    "@harmoniclabs/koios-pluts": "^0.1.3",
    "@harmoniclabs/uint8array-utils": "^1.0.0",
    "@meshsdk/core": "^1.5.2",
    "@meshsdk/react": "^1.1.7",
    /* other deps */
}
```

So now we only need to run `npm install` to add them automatically.

```sh
npm install
```

_et voilà_ we are ready to start!

### Project Overview

The project structure shows you can find the code in the `src` and the `contracts` folders.

The `contracts` only file is the `helloPluts.ts` one, which for now contains only a contract that always fails and exports the compiled result.

```ts title="contracts/helloPluts.ts"
import {
	Address,
	PScriptContext,
	PaymentCredentials,
	Script,
	bool,
	compile,
	data,
	makeValidator,
	pBool,
	pfn,
} from '@harmoniclabs/plu-ts';

const helloPluts = pfn(
	[data, data, PScriptContext.type],
	bool
)((datum, redeemer, ctx) => {
	// locks funds forever
	return pBool(false);
});

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// ------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ------------------------- utilities ------------------------- //
// ------------------------------------------------------------- //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

export const untypedValidator = makeValidator(helloPluts);

export const compiledContract = compile(untypedValidator);

export const script = new Script('PlutusScriptV2', compiledContract);

export const scriptTestnetAddr = new Address(
	'testnet',
	PaymentCredentials.script(script.hash)
);
```

We'll come back to this file later.

The other two files we'll work with are `src/offchain/lockTx.ts` and `src/offchain/unlockTx.ts`.

Both are very similar.

```ts title="src/offchain/lockTx.ts"
import { Tx } from '@harmoniclabs/plu-ts';
import { BrowserWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';
import koios from './koios';

async function getLockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<Tx> {
	throw "'lockTx' logic not implemented";
}

export async function lockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<string> {
	const unsingedTx = await getLockTx(wallet);

	const txStr = await wallet.signTx(unsingedTx.toCbor().toString());

	return (await koios.tx.submit(Tx.fromCbor(txStr) as any)).toString();
}
```

```ts title="src/offchain/unlockTx.ts"
import { Tx } from '@harmoniclabs/plu-ts';
import { BrowserWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';
import { koios } from './koios';

async function getUnlockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<Tx> {
	throw "'unlockTx' logic not implemented";
}

export async function unlockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<string> {
	const unsingedTx = await getUnlockTx(wallet);

	const txStr = await wallet.signTx(
		unsingedTx.toCbor().toString(),
		true // partial sign because we have smart contracts in the transaction
	);

	return (await koios.tx.submit(Tx.fromCbor(txStr))).toString();
}
```

Our work later in this project will be to create the transactions that will interact with the contract.

This will be done using the plu-ts [`TxBuilder`](../offchain/TxBuilder%20API/TxBuilder).

We defined the code to get a `TxBuilder` instance in the `src/offchain/getTxBuilder.ts`

```ts title="src/offchain/getTxBuilder.ts"
import {
	ProtocolParamters,
	TxBuilder,
	defaultProtocolParameters,
} from '@harmoniclabs/plu-ts';
import { koios } from './koios';

/**
 * we don't want to do too many API calls if we already have our `txBuilder.`
 *
 * so, after the first call, we'll store a copy here.
 **/
let _cachedTxBuilder: TxBuilder | undefined = undefined;

export default async function getTxBuilder(): Promise<TxBuilder> {
	if (!(_cachedTxBuilder instanceof TxBuilder)) {
		try {
			const pp =
				(await koios.epoch.protocolParams()) as Readonly<ProtocolParamters>;

			_cachedTxBuilder = new TxBuilder('testnet', pp);
		} catch {
			// just in case koios returns protocol parameters that don't look good
			// if that happens, then use the default protocol parameters
			// !!! IMPORTANT !!! use only as a fallback;
			// parameters might (and will) change from the real world
			_cachedTxBuilder = new TxBuilder('testnet', defaultProtocolParameters);
		}
	}

	return _cachedTxBuilder;
}
```

Constructing a `TxBuilder` requires us to pass the protocol parameters of our operating chain.

:::caution why the `try{ ... }catch{ ... }` here?

If the protocol parameters passed are incorrect (for any reason), the TxBuilder constructor throws.

In that case, we can use the `defaultProtocolParameters` exported by `plu-ts`, which are always valid.

However (as the comment above explains), these parameters might not reflect reality, so you should use them cautiously.

:::

To get the protocol parameters, we are using a `koios` object; we export this from the `src/offchain/koios.ts` file.

```ts title="src/offchain/koios.ts"
import { KoiosProvider } from '@harmoniclabs/koios-pluts';

export const koios = new KoiosProvider('preprod');

export default koios;
```

The file is straightforward, and this is because we are using the [`koios-pluts`](../tools/koios-pluts) package.

Here we construct a `KoiosProvider` instance that will do the koios REST API calls for us.

Then there is the website.

This website is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. Of which the only page is in `src/pages/index.tsx`

```tsx title="src/pages/index.tsx"
import { Button, useToast } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { useNetwork, useWallet } from '@meshsdk/react';

import style from '@/styles/Home.module.css';
import ConnectionHandler from '@/components/ConnectionHandler';
import { lockTx } from '@/offchain/lockTx';
import { unlockTx } from '@/offchain/unlockTx';

export default function Home() {
	const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();
	const network = useNetwork();
	const toast = useToast();

	if (typeof network === 'number' && network !== 0) {
		return (
			<div
				className={[style.pageContainer, 'center-child-flex-even'].join(' ')}>
				<b
					style={{
						margin: 'auto 10vw',
					}}>
					Make sure to set your wallet in testnet mode;
					<br />
					We are playing with funds here!
				</b>
				<Button
					onClick={() => window.location.reload()}
					style={{
						margin: 'auto 10vw',
					}}>
					Refersh page
				</Button>
			</div>
		);
	}

	function onLock() {
		lockTx(wallet)
			// lock transaction created successfully
			.then((txHash) =>
				toast({
					title: `lock tx submitted: https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/transaction/${txHash}`,
					status: 'success',
				})
			)
			// lock transaction failed
			.catch((e) => {
				toast({
					title: `Something went wrong`,
					status: 'error',
				});
				console.error(e);
			});
	}

	function onUnlock() {
		unlockTx(wallet)
			// unlock transaction created successfully
			.then((txHash) =>
				toast({
					title: `unlock tx submitted: https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/transaction/${txHash}`,
					status: 'success',
				})
			)
			// unlock transaction failed
			.catch((e) => {
				toast({
					title: `Something went wrong`,
					status: 'error',
				});
				console.error(e);
			});
	}

	return (
		<div className={[style.pageContainer, 'center-child-flex-even'].join(' ')}>
			<ConnectionHandler />
			{connected && (
				<>
					<Button onClick={onLock}>Lock 10 tADA</Button>
					<Button onClick={onUnlock}>Unlock</Button>
				</>
			)}
		</div>
	);
}
```

All the logic of the user interface (UI) is happening here.

We are using the `useNetwork` react hook imported from [`@meshsdk/react`](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks)
to prevent users from playing with the contract in the mainnet.

But the cool part is the `useWallet` hook that gives us access to the user's wallet once connected.

The connection happens in the `ConnectionHandler` component we defined in `src/components/ConnectionHandler.ts`.
You can check it yourself if you want to see how easy the connection process becomes with [`@meshsdk/react`](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks)

And with that, this is it.

You can try this web application running

```sh
npm run dev
```

Running the web application will output something like the following:

```

> hello-pluts-react@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, URL: http://localhost:3000
```

The numbers may vary a little, but that is not a problem.

You can check out the website by going to the specified URL; the example above is `http://localhost:3000`.

However, at this very moment, the app won't do much.

So let's start by defining what the contract should do.

## The contract

We want to personalize the smart contract so that:

- it succeeds if we sign the transaction.
- and we are being polite by saluting the contract.

### Introduce an `owner.`

To ensure we sign the transaction, we'll keep track of an `owner` in the datum (the first argument we saw in the contract).

:::tip datum

The datum helps us keep track of the history of the input the smart contract is validating.

:::

Currently, our datum is a generic `data` argument, but it could be anything;

In our case, we only need to keep track of an owner, and we can identify them using a public key hash.

So in `src/contract.ts`, we will change the first `data` to [`PPubKeyHash`](../onchain/API/types/PPubKeyHash)

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
/* imports */

const helloPluts = pfn(
	[
		// highlight-next-line
		PPubKeyHash.type,
		data,
		PScriptContext.type,
	],
	bool
)(
	// highlight-next-line
	//  datum -> owner
	// highlight-next-line
	(owner, redeemer, ctx) => {
		// locks funds forever
		return pBool(false);
	}
);

/* ... */
```

### Send messages to the contracts

The second condition requires us to send some messages to the contract.

Sending messages is done thanks to the redeemer (or the second argument of a validator).

:::info redeemer

The redeemer is the argument the user specifies that interacts with the smart contract.

:::

once again, all we need to have a message is just a `bytestring`, nothing more complex,

so we'll change the second `data` to the primitive type `bs`.

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
/* imports */

const helloPluts = pfn(
	[
		PPubKeyHash.type,
		// highlight-next-line
		bs,
		PScriptContext.type,
	],
	bool
)(
	// highlight-next-line
	//  redeemer -> message
	// highlight-next-line
	(owner, message, ctx) => {
		// locks funds forever
		return pBool(false);
	}
);

/* ... */
```

### Implement the logic

Finally, we'll check both the conditions in the function's body.

So we'll first create a term that checks that the message is the one expected:

```ts
const isBeingPolite = message.eq('Hello plu-ts');
```

Then we'll check that the owner signs the transaction specified in the datum.

To do so, we need information about the transaction and who signed it.

All the information about the transaction is in the `tx` field of the [`PScriptContex`](../onchain/API/types/PScriptContex)

and in particular, we are interested in the [`signatories` field](../onchain/API/types/PTxInfo#signatories)

```ts
ctx.tx.signatories;
```

since this is a list of all the required singers, we can use all the [`TermList`](../onchain/stdlib/TermList) methods;
of which [`some`](../onchain/stdlib/TermList#some) allows us to check that **at least one** element of the list respects a given property:

```ts
const signedByOwner = ctx.tx.signatories.some(owner.eqTerm);
```

Finally, we put it all together:

```ts title="src/contract.ts"
import {
	Address,
	PPubKeyHash,
	PScriptContext,
	PaymentCredentials,
	Script,
	bool,
	bs,
	compile,
	makeValidator,
	pfn,
} from '@harmoniclabs/plu-ts';

const helloPluts = pfn(
	[PPubKeyHash.type, bs, PScriptContext.type],
	bool
)((owner, message, ctx) => {
	// highlight-start
	const isBeingPolite = message.eq('Hello plu-ts');

	const signedByOwner = ctx.tx.signatories.some(owner.eqTerm);

	return isBeingPolite.and(signedByOwner);
	// highlight-end
});

/* ... */
```

And that's it! We have our contract.

To test it, however, we need to create transactions with it...

## Lock some funds

For the smart contract to run, it first needs something to spend;
so now we will build a transaction that sends some funds to the contract
and provides the datum we will use when the funds we send are spent.

:::info datum

As said before, the datum acts as the contract local memory.

For this reason, we must set it now that we are funding the contract;
as such; the datum is not provided in the spending transaction
(or if it is, it has to match the one that we set in the transaction before;
otherwise, the transaction is invalid)

:::

So far, what we have is this:

```ts title="src/offchain/lockTx.ts"
async function getLockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<Tx> {
	throw "'lockTx' logic not implemented";
}
```

### `myAddr`

The function takes as input the wallet with which the user is connected.

The first thing we can do with the wallet is to request the user's address:

```ts
await wallet.getChangeAddress();
```

That expression returns a string which is a Cardano address in bech32 format (`"addr_test1v..."`)

A string isn't that useful, so we'll use that to build a plu-ts `Address` instance:

```ts
const myAddr = Address.fromString(await wallet.getChangeAddress());
```

### `txBuilder`

Since we want to build a transition here, it might be a good idea to have a `TxBuilder` instance to help us.

We already have the code to create one in the `src/offchain/getTxBuilder.ts` file, so we need to import it and call the function.

```ts
const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
```

### `myUTxOs`

A transaction expects as input some output of a previous transaction that hasn't been spent yet;

people call this stuff UTxO (**U**nspent **T**ransa*ct*ion **O**utput).

The `BrowserWallet` turns ourselves useful once again here; we can get the wallet utxos calling

```ts
await wallet.getUtxos();
```

However, since this is a function defined by `mesh`, it is not of the type that the plu-ts `TxBuilder` expects.

For this reason, we can `map` `toPlutsUtxo` (defined in `src/offchain/mesh-utils.ts`) over the result of the `getUtxos` call;
so that `myUTxOs` is defined as:

```ts
myUTxOs = (await wallet.getUtxos()).map(toPlutsUtxo);

if (myUTxOs.length === 0) {
	throw new Error('have you requested funds from the faucet?');
}
```

:::tip get some funds

If `myUTxOs` happens to be empty (`length === 0`), your wallet has nothing in it.

If that is the case, you can use the [Cardano Testnet Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to get some testnet funds.

Just be sure to select the **Preprod** testnet.

:::

:::caution return the test ADA

Once you finish with your tADA, please return them to the faucet.

tADA have no real-world value but is still limited; other developers will need them!

To return tADA to the faucet, send them to the following testnet address:

`addr_test1qqr585tvlc7ylnqvz8pyqwauzrdu0mxag3m7q56grgmgu7sxu2hyfhlkwuxupa9d5085eunq2qywy7hvmvej456flknswgndm3`

:::

### `utxo`

With this transaction, we want to send 10 ADA to the contract.

So we search between the utxos we already have for one that has a little more than that (so we can cover the transaction fees).

```ts
const utxo = myUTxOs.find((u) => u.resolved.value.lovelaces > 15_000_000);

if (utxo === undefined) {
	throw 'not enough ada';
}
```

### Build and return the transaction

And with all this, we have:

- a user utxo to use as input
- the `scriptTestnetAddr` (imported from `contracts/helloPluts.ts`), which is the script address to use in the output
- the user public key hash that we'll use as output datum

Which is all we need for our transaction;

So we can build it using the `txBuilder` we have:

```ts
txBuilder.buildSync({
	inputs: [{ utxo }],
	outputs: [
		{
			// output holding the funds that we'll spend later
			address: scriptTestnetAddr,
			// 10M lovelaces === 10 ADA
			value: Value.lovelaces(10_000_000),
			// remeber to include a datum
			datum: new DataB(
				//Remember we set the datum to be the public key hash?
				//We can extract it from the address as follows
				myAddr.paymentCreds.hash.toBuffer()
			),
		},
	],
	//Send everything left back to us
	changeAddress: myAddr,
});
```

So that the final `getLockTx` function should look like this:

```ts title="src/offchain/lockTx.ts"
async function getLockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<Tx> {
	// creates an address form the bech32 form
	const myAddr = Address.fromString(await wallet.getChangeAddress());

	const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
	const myUTxOs = (await wallet.getUtxos()).map(toPlutsUtxo);

	if (myUTxOs.length === 0) {
		throw new Error('have you requested funds from the faucet?');
	}

	const utxo = myUTxOs.find((u) => u.resolved.value.lovelaces > 15_000_000);

	if (utxo === undefined) {
		throw 'not enough ada';
	}

	return txBuilder.buildSync({
		inputs: [{ utxo }],
		outputs: [
			{
				// output holding the funds that we'll spend later
				address: scriptTestnetAddr,
				// 10M lovelaces === 10 ADA
				value: Value.lovelaces(10_000_000),
				// remeber to include a datum
				datum: new DataB(
					//Remember we set the datum to be the public key hash?
					//We can extract it from the address as follows
					myAddr.paymentCreds.hash.toBuffer()
				),
			},
		],
		//Send everything left back to us
		changeAddress: myAddr,
	});
}
```

### Test it out

With `getLockTx` implemented, the first button on the webpage should now work.

To test it out, run the following:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to the specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`);

Then connect your wallet and click the `Lock 10 tADA` button.

If everything works correctly, you should get a prompt asking you to sign a transaction.

![sing transaciton pop-up](sign_lock_hello_world.gif)

## Unlock the funds

Now that the smart contract has something to spend, we can test it.

Our smart contract never ran so far.

Cardano smart contracts only run if funds need to be spent (some call them "Spending Validators").

So now we will do precisely that; we will spend some of (our) smart contract funds.

The starting point is similar to before.

```ts title="src/offchain/getUnlockTx.ts"
async function getUnlockTx(wallet: BrowserWallet): Promise<Tx> {
	throw "'unlockTx' logic not implemented";
}
```

### `txBuilder` and `myUTxOs`

For the Transaction builder and utxos for the transaction, the steps are the same:

```ts
const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
const myUTxOs = (await wallet.getUtxos()).map(toPlutsUtxo);
```

### `myAddrs` and `myAddr`

Before, we got the user address by calling `wallet.getChangeAddress`.

`wallet.getChangeAddress` returns a single address of the contract. But a wallet might have many, and for now, we are still determining which one we'll get this time, so we'll select it manually.

to get all the addresses of a wallet we can call

```ts
await wallet.getUsedAddresses();
```

Like before, the method returns strings, so we'll need to call `Address.fromString` for each.

This way, we can get all the wallet addresses as follows:

```ts
const myAddrs = (await wallet.getUsedAddresses()).map(Address.fromString);
```

From these, we'll decide which one we will use in the next step.

For now, let's declare a variable for it.

```ts
let myAddr!: Address;
```

### Get the script's utxos

Script utxos are a bit trickier... scripts don't have wallets!

So to retrieve the script's utxos, we'll rely on koios; the code to query them is:

```ts
await koios.address.utxos(scriptTestnetAddr);
```

Where `scriptTestnetAddr` is imported from `contracts/helloPluts.ts`.

But a script might (and will) have multiple utxos. So how do we know which one is ours?

For that, we'll search between them using the following function:

```ts
const utxoToSpend = (await koios.address.utxos(scriptTestnetAddr)).find(
	(utxo) => {
		const datum = utxo.resolved.datum;

		if (
			// datum is inline
			isData(datum) &&
			// and is only bytes
			datum instanceof DataB
		) {
			const pkh = datum.bytes.toBuffer();

			// search if it corresponds to one of my public keys
			const myPkhIdx = myAddrs.findIndex((addr) =>
				uint8ArrayEq(pkh, addr.paymentCreds.hash.toBuffer())
			);

			// not a pkh of mine; not an utxo I can unlock
			if (myPkhIdx < 0) return false;

			// else found my locked utxo
			myAddr = myAddrs[myPkhIdx];

			return true;
		}

		return false;
	}
);
```

Given a utxo, we first need to check that it has an inline datum and that the datum is just made of bytes.

Once we know the datum is in the correct format, we extract the set public key hash that represents that utxo owner:

```ts
const pkh = datum.bytes.toBuffer();
```

and finally, we check for the owner to be equal to any of the addresses in control of the wallet;
if any address matches, we find the address we will use and the utxo to be spent; otherwise, we check another utxo.

After the filter call, `myAddr` will then be defined.

### Build the transaction

Now we have everything needed; we can build the unlocking transaction:

```ts
txBuilder.buildSync({
	inputs: [
		{
			utxo: utxoToSpend as any,
			//We must include the utxo that holds our script
			inputScript: {
				script,
				datum: 'inline', // the datum is present already on `utxoToSpend.`
				redeemer: new DataB(fromAscii('Hello plu-ts')), // be polite
			},
		},
	],
	requiredSigners: [myAddr.paymentCreds.hash],
	//Make sure to include collateral when using contracts
	collaterals: [myUTxOs[0]],
	//Send everything back to us
	changeAddress: myAddr,
});
```

This time, the transaction is more complicated, so let's check what's new.

First of all, the input now comes from a script! For this reason, we have to include the script alongside the utxo to be spent for the script to validate it.

We include the script through the `inputScript` option:

```ts
inputScript: {
    script,
    datum: "inline", // the datum is present already on `utxoToSpend.`
    redeemer: new DataB( fromAscii("Hello plu-ts") ) // be polite
}
```

The `script` is the one imported from `contracts/helloPluts.ts`.

`datum` is set to be `inline`, which means that the datum is already present on the UTxO being spent.

Finally, `redeemer` is used to pass the redeemer to call the contract.

:::tip redeemer

Unlike the datum, the redeemer is used to pass data to the script when calling it.

We can do this to communicate between the user and the contract.

:::

The other important part of the transaction is the `requiredSigners` option.

Here we have to specify our public key hash to include it in the `signatories` field of the context passed to the contract.
If we forget it, the `ctx.tx.signatories` value in our smart contract will be empty!

Finally, the third news is the `collaterals` option; this can be any utxo we own as long as it contains only ADA;
if it includes any other token, we must return it using the `collateralReturn` option, but this is not our case.

So our final `getUnlockTx` function looks like this.

```ts title="src/offchain/getUnlockTx.ts"
async function getUnlockTx( wallet: BrowserWallet ): Promise<Tx>
{
    const myAddrs = (await wallet.getUsedAddresses()).map( Address.fromString );

    const txBuilder = await getTxBuilder();
    const myUTxOs = (await wallet.getUtxos()).map( toPlutsUtxo );

    /**
     * Wallets might have multiple addresses;
     *
     * to understand which one we previously used to lock founds
     * we'll get the address based on the utxo that keeps one of ours
     * public key hash as datum
    **/
    let myAddr!: Address;

    // only the ones with valid datum
    const utxoToSpend = (await koios.address.utxos( scriptTestnetAddr ))
    .find( utxo => {
        const datum = utxo.resolved.datum;

        if(
            // datum is inline
            isData( datum ) &&
            // and is only bytes
            datum instanceof DataB
        )
        {
            const pkh = datum.bytes.toBuffer();

            // search if it corresponds to one of my public keys
            const myPkhIdx = myAddrs.findIndex(
                addr => uint8ArrayEq( pkh, addr.paymentCreds.hash.toBuffer() )
            );

            // not a pkh of mine; not an utxo I can unlock
            if( myPkhIdx < 0 ) return false;

            // else found my locked utxo
            myAddr = myAddrs[ myPkhIdx ];

            return true;
        }

        return false;
    });

    if( utxoToSpend === undefined )
    {
        throw, "Uopsie, are you sure your tx had enough time to get to the blockchain?"
    }

    return txBuilder.buildSync({
        inputs: [
            {
                utxo: utxoToSpend as any,
                //We must include the utxo that holds our script
                inputScript: {
                    script,
                    datum: "inline", // the datum is present already on `utxoToSpend.`
                    redeemer: new DataB( fromAscii("Hello plu-ts") ) // be polite
                }
            }
        ],
        requiredSigners: [ myAddr.paymentCreds.hash ],
        //Make sure to include collateral when using contracts
        collaterals: [ myUTxOs[0] ],
        //Send everything back to us
        changeAddress: myAddr
    });
}
```

### Test the contract

Now our application is complete.

We need to test out the last feature introduced.

Once again, spin up the web page, and this time, let's click on the second button.

:::tip smart contract determinism

Did you know that smart contracts on Cardano are deterministic?

It means that you always get the same output when you run them with the same inputs.

For this reason, the plu-ts `TxBuilder` can pre-evaluate your transaction
and will throw an error if the script fails!

That means that if you are signing a transaction built with plu-ts, you can be sure there are no surprises!

Here is an example of a succeeding transaction:
