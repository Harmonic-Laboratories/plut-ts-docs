# `TxBuilder`

`plu-ts/offchain` exposes the `TxBuilder` class.

## Why?

Its purpose is to allow you to build transactions more easly.

You could infact build transactions by calling the `Tx` constructor.

However that requires a profound understanding of the structure of a Cardano transaction.

for this reason we have the `TxBuilder`.

You can get your `TxBuilder` instance by specifying the network to operate in (`"mainnet" | "testnet"`) and its protocol paramters (that you'll need to query)

```ts
const txBuilder = new TxBuilder(
    "mainnet",
    await fetch("https://some-api.com/get-my-protocol-params")
)
```

## What does it do?

once you have your tx builder you can use it to build (and validate transactions).

it has 2 main methods: `build` and `buildSync`.

As for now `build` is really just wrapping `buildSync` in a `Promise`;
but in a future version it will be able to offload eventual smart contracts validation to a [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker).

The `buildSync` interface is:
```ts
 buildSync({
        inputs,
        changeAddress,
        outputs,
        readonlyRefInputs,
        requiredSigners,
        collaterals,
        collateralReturn,
        mints,
        invalidBefore,
        invalidAfter,
        certificates,
        withdrawals,
        metadata,
        protocolUpdateProposal
    }: ITxBuildArgs,
    {
        onScriptInvalid,
        onScriptResult
    }: ITxBuildOptions = {}
): Tx
```

and it is inspired by `cardano-cli`.
