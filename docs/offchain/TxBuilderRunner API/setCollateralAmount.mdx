# `setCollateralAmount`

```ts
readonly setCollateralAmount!: ( lovelaces: number | bigint ) => TxBuilderRunner
```

- `lovelaces`: `number` | `bigint`

Sets the collateral amount for a transaction.

If [`setCollateral`](./setCollateral) is not used, but the transaction needs collateral due to the presence of a plutus script,
the [`TxBuilderRunner`](./TxBuilderRunner) instance will try to use one of the normal inputs as collateral.

In case this happens, it is possible to limit the amount of the collateral using this method.

returns a reference to the same [`TxBuilderRunner`](./TxBuilderRunner).
