# `TermFn<PIns[],POut>`

The type definition of `TermFn` is more complex than what it actually does; but that is only because it automatically handles functions with an unspecified (potentially infinite) number of parameters;

All it does tough is just adding the "`$`" method that replaces the `papp` call.

to give an idea here how the case of a function from a single input to a single output looks like;

we'll call this type `TermLam` even if there's no type called so in `plu-ts`

```ts
type TermLam<PIn extends PType, POut extends PType> =
    Term<PLam<PIn,POut>> & {
        $: ( input: Term<PIn> ) => Term<POut>
    }
```
