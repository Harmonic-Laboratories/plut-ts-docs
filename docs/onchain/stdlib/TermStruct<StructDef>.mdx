# `TermStruct<StructDef>`

`TermStruct` is an other type that is unnecessarily complicated.

This time because it has to mess around with the struct definition; 
but even so the type definition should not be that hard to understand if we know what is doing

```ts
type StructInstance<SCtorDef extends StructCtorDef> = {
    readonly [Field in keyof SCtorDef]: UtilityTermOf<ToPType<SCtorDef[Field]>>
}

type TermStruct<SDef extends StructDefinition> = Term<PStruct<SDef>> & {
    
    readonly eqTerm: TermFn<[PStruct<SDef>], PBool>
    readonly eq: ( other: Term<PStruct<SDef>> ) => TermBool

} & 
    IsSingelKey<SDef> extends true ? StructInstance<SDef[keyof SCtorDef]> : {};
```

Even with these simplifications it might seem a bit complex but really all is telling us is that it adds the struct properties (trough `Structinstance`) 
_only if_ the struct can only have one single constructor; and adds nothing if it has more.

In fact we already encountered [this method while introducing `pmatch`](../Control%20Flow/pmatch); we just didn't know that it was an utility term.

It then adds the `eq` method regardless of the struct definition.

## `eq`

:::note `eq`

parameter: `other` type: `Term<PStruct<SDef>>`

returns: `TermBool`

equivalent expression:
```ts
peqData.$( term as any ).$( other  as any )
```
