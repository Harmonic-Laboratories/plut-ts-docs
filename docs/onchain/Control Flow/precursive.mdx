# `precursive`

The other thing we are missing to have a proper language is some way to repeat the execution of some code.

The functional paradigm doesn't really like things like the loops we have in Typescript but that is not a big deal, because we can use recursive functions instead.

Turns out someone else already came up with a solution for that so that we don't have to.

That solution is the **Y combinator** (actually we'll use the _Z combinator_ but whatever).

:::note

We'll not go in the details on how it works, but if you are a curious one here's a great article that explains the [Y combinator in javascript terms](https://medium.com/swlh/y-and-z-combinators-in-javascript-lambda-calculus-with-real-code-31f25be934ec)

All you need to know is that it allows functions to have themselves as parameters, and this solves everything!

In `plu-ts` there is a special typescript function that makes `plu-ts` functions recursive, and it's named, you guessed it, `precursive`.

All `precursive` requires to make a `plu-ts` function recursive is that we pass the function as the first parameter, and then we can do whatever we want with it.

So let's try to define a `plu-ts` function that caluclates the factorial of a positive number:

```ts
const pfactorial = precursive(
    pfn([
        // remember that the first argument is the function itself?
        // for this reason as first type we specify
        // what will be the final type of the function
        // because what we have here IS the function itself
        // highlight-next-line
        lam( int, int ),
        int
    ],  int)
    (( self, n ) =>
        pif( int ).$(
            n.ltEq( 1 )
        )
        .then( 1 )
        .else(
            // highlight-start
            // here we are applying this same function
            // this is the equivalent of writing 
            // `pfactorial.$( n.sub( 1 ) )`
            self.$( n.sub( 1 ) )
            // highlight-end
            .mult( n )
        )
    )
)
```

Now we can use `pfactorial` just like a normal function; this is because `precursive` takes care of passing the first argument, so that the actual type of `pfactorial` is just `lam( int, int )`

The next step is to learn how to [evaluate expressions](../Evaluating%20and%20testing/evaluation) so that we can be sure that `pfactorial` is working as we expect.
