# Types

As we saw in [Concepts](./Concepts) `plu-ts` is an eDSL embedded in Typescript, as such we have two type systems; the Typescript one and the `plu-ts` one 

## Typescript Types
- `Term` is a Typescript type defined in `plu-ts`. 
- Every value in `plu-ts` is a `Term`. In Typescript, we say each value *extends* Term (in the same way that "Dog" extends "Mammal").
- A `Term` also keeps track of the type of the value it holds. 

The possible types a `Term` can keep track of are defined in [PTypes](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts/tree/main/src/onchain/pluts/PTypes), and listed here:

- `PUnit` a unique value that has no real meaning; you can see it as `plu-ts` version of `undefined` or `null` in Typescript
- `PInt` a signed integer that can be as big as you want
- `PBool` a boolean value
- `PByteString` equivalent of a `Buffer` or a [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array)
- `PString` equivalent of the Typescript `string`
- `PData` equivalent of the `object` type in Typescript (it is the low level representation of `PStruct`s that we'll cover in a moment, so you usually won't use `PData`)
- `PList<PType>` equivalent of an Array in Typescript; note that all the elements in the list must be of the same `PType`
- `PPair<PType1, PType2>` equivalent of a Typescript tuple (`[ type1 , type2 ]`)
- `PDelayed<PType>` a delayed computation that returns a value of type `PType`; the computation can be run by passing the delayed value to the `pforce` function
- `PLam<PInput, POutput>` a function that takes one single argument of type `PInput` and returns something of type `POutput`
- `PFn<[ PInput_0 , ...PType[] ],POutput>` a function that takes multiple arguments (at least one) and returns something of type `POutput`
- `PAlias<PType>` just an alias of the provided type; it behaves exactly like the Types of its argument, so `PAlias<PInt>` is equivalent to a `PInt`. This is useful for keeping track of a different meaning the type might have.
- `PStruct<{...}>` an abstraction over `PData`, useful to construct more complex data structures.

## `plu-ts` Types

`plu-ts` would not be a strongly typed language if limited to Typescript types, because the types of Typescript are only useful during compilation to javascript; and then everything is untyped!

:::info
Typescript can be compiled to Javascript. When this happens, the resulting Javascript is untyped!

For this reason `plu-ts` implements its own type through some constants and functions that can be imported.
:::


In the same order of above, the `plu-ts` equivalents are:

- `PUnit` -> `unit`
- `PInt` -> `int`
- `PBool` -> `bool`
- `PByteString` -> `bs`
- `PString` -> `str`
- `PData` -> `data`
- `PList` -> `list( type )`
- `PPair` -> `pair( type1, type2 )`
- `PDelayed` -> `delayed( type )`
- `PLam` -> `lam( from, to )`
- `PFn` -> `fn([ ...inputs ], output )`
- aliases types and structs types will be retreived by the `type` static property of the classes (explained in the dedicated section for [aliases](./aliases.md) and [structs](./structs.md))

## `plu-ts` generics

As we know, Typescript gives us the possibility to define polymorphic types trough generics.

In a way you could see generics as _functions_ that take a type as input and returns another type.

Fortunately for us, `plu-ts` types are just values when seen from the Typescript world, so we can have some sort of generic in `plu-ts` too!

To see how, let's try to define the previous polymorphic types using the generic method:
```ts
const anyPlutsFunction = ( a: TermType, b: TermType ) => lam( a, b );

const identityFunctionType = ( a: TermType ) => lam( a, a );

const mkPairType = ( a: TermType, b: TermType ) => fn([ a, b ], pair( a, b ) )
```

Polymorphic types defined as functions also have the advantage of being fully defined once the type arguments are passed.

This works great, but there's still a problem though... Typescript isn't able to infer these types!

This is because `TermType` is the generic type for all `plu-ts` types, so when Typescript tries to infer the type of the term, it sees the most generic type of all, and once again thinks we want to use the anonymous `PType`.

To finally solve this problem we need to make the functions generic too:
```ts
function anyFunction<A extends TermType, B extends TermType>( a: A, b: B )
{ 
    return lam( a, b ) 
};

function identityFunctionType<A extends TermType>( a: A )
{ 
    return lam( a, a ) 
};

function mkPairType<A extends TermType, B extends TermType>( a: A, b: B )
{ 
    return fn([ a, b ], pair( a, b ) ) 
};
```

This way Typescript first infers the specific `TermType` we are passing, and with that is able to determine the exact type of the Term.

Generics will turn useful especially in the case where the type requires a type variable as return type, a notable example is `pif` which is of type `bool -> a -> a -> a`.
