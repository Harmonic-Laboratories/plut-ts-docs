# `compile`

Once we have our contract we need to transform it in something that the cardano node understands.

For that we have the `compile` function.

```ts
function compile(
    term: Term<PType>, 
    version?: [number, number, number]
): Uint8Array;
```

`compile` takes **any** Term as input and returns an `Uint8Array` that are the `flat` srialization of the Term.

It optionally takes a touple of 3 `number`s (expected to be all positive integer) representing the contract version.

The version defaults to `[ 1, 0, 0 ]` and is unlikely you will ever need to specify it.

:::info `flat` format

The `flat` format is how the contract is stored on chain. 

However is not the format **is not** how it is include in a transaction (nor how it is used by `cardano-cli`)

top use the result of `compile` you should pass it to a `Script` constructor so that it can handle the format for you.
