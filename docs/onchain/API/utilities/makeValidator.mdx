# `makeValidator`

:::caution [!CAUTION]
This method is deprecated as of Plutus V3
:::

Once on-chain contracts are not typed. Instead they only receive generic `data` arguments.

This is why `makeValidator` exists. 

The type signature is not too complicated:

```ts
export function makeValidator(
    typedValidator: Term<
        PLam<
            PType,
            PLam<
                PType,
                PLam<
                    typeof PScriptContext, 
                    PBool
                >
            >
        >
    >,
    errorMessage?: string
): TermFn<[PData,PData,PData], PUnit>

```

As you can see it takes any typed validator and returns a generic untyped validator so that the node will be able to evaluate it correctly.

:::caution use `makeValidator` only for spending scripts

As you can see; `makeValidator` expects a contract with 3 arguments.

This means it can only be used for contracts with `Spending` as `PScriptPurpose`

For all other purposes you likely want to use [`makeRedeemerValidator`](./makeRedeemerValidator)

### errorMessage

Optionally you can pass a `string` that will be included in the on-chain script and passed to `ptrace` in case of failure
