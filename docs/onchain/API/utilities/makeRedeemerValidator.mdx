# `makeRedeemerValidator`

:::caution [!CAUTION]

As said in [`makeValidator`], once on-chain contracts are not typed.

`makeRedeemerValidator` is used for contract that do not expect a datum as first argument.

The type signature is:

```ts
export function makeRedeemerValidator(
    typedValidator: Term<
        PLam<
            PType,
            PLam<
                typeof PScriptContext, 
                PBool
            >
        >
    >,
    errorMessage?: string
): TermFn<[PData,PData], PUnit>

```

As you can see it takes any typed validator and returns a generic untyped validator so that the node will be able to evaluate it correctly.

### errorMessage

Optionally you can pass a `string` that will be included in the on-chain script and passed to `ptrace` in case of failure
