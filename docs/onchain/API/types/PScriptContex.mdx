# `PScriptContex`

The Script Context is probably the most important piece of data your script receives.

That is because this data is passed directly by the cardano node during the contract evaluation; hence it can always be trusted.


definition:

```ts
export const PScriptContext = pstruct({
    PScriptContext: {
        tx: PTxInfo.type,
        purpose: PScriptPurpose.type
    }
});
```

We see it has a single constructor that includes 2 fields:


### `tx`

`tx` of type [`PTxInfo`](./PTxInfo)

### `purpose`

`purpose` of type [`PScriptPurpose`](./PScriptPurpose)
