# `PBound`

Represents a bound in a range with an associated inclusivity flag. 
The `PBound` type is typically used to define the bounds of an interval, where each bound is either inclusive or exclusive, and the value of the bound itself is described by an `PExtended` type.

Definition:

```ts
import { pstruct } from "../../../PTypes/PStruct/pstruct";
import { bool } from "../../../type_system/types";
import { PExtended } from "./PExtended";

export const PBound = pstruct({
    PBound: {
        bound: PExtended.type,
        inclusive: bool 
    }
});
```

## `bound`

This field specifies the actual value of the boundary in the interval. This can either be a concrete value or an infinite one (i.e., open-ended bound).
The `PExtended` type allows for this flexibility by supporting both finite and infinite bounds.

type: [`PExtended`](./PExtended)

### `inclusive`

A boolean flag that indicates whether the bound is inclusive or exclusive, meaning part or not part of the interval

type: [`bool`](../../stdlib/TermBool)
