# `PInterval`

Used to describe the time interval in which a transaction is considered valid, defining a start and end time using `PBound` for each. 
Both bounds (`from` and `to`) can represent either finite times or infinite boundaries (open-ended intervals).

Definition:

```ts
import { pstruct } from "../../../PTypes/PStruct/pstruct";
import { PBound } from "./PBound";

export const PInterval = pstruct({
    PInterval: {
        from: PBound.type,
        to: PBound.type
    }
});
```

## from

type: [`PBound`](./PBound)

## to

type: [`PBound`](./PBound)
