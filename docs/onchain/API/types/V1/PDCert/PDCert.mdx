:::caution [!CAUTION]

:::warning
Renamed and modified to [`PCertificate`](../../V3/ScriptContext/PCertificate) in V3 version
:::

It represents any possible certificate that can be included in a transaction. These certificates are essential for managing staking keys, delegating stake, and controlling stake pools. 

Definition:

```ts
export const PDCert = pstruct({
    KeyRegistration: { stakeKey: PStakingCredential.type },
    KeyDeRegistration: { stakeKey: PStakingCredential.type },
    KeyDelegation: {
        delegator: PStakingCredential.type,
        poolKeyHash: PPubKeyHash.type
    },
    PoolRegistration: {
        poolId: PPubKeyHash.type,
        poolVRF: PPubKeyHash.type
    },
    PoolRetire: {
        poolId: PPubKeyHash.type,
        epoch: int
    },
    Genesis: {},
    MoveInstantRewards: {}
});
```

## `KeyRegistration`

This certificate is used to register a staking key (delegation or operating a stake pool).

### `stakeKey`
Represents the staking credential being deregistered.

type: [`PStakingCredential`](../Address/PStakingCredential)

## `KeyDeRegistration`

This certificate is used to deregister a staking key, effectively removing the stake key from the staking system.

### `stakeKey`
Represents the staking credential being deregistered.

type: [`PStakingCredential`](../Address/PStakingCredential)

## `KeyDelegation`

This certificate is used to delegate stake from a delegator's staking key to a specific stake pool.

### `delegator`
The staking key of the person delegating their stake.

type: [`PStakingCredential`](../Address/PStakingCredential)

### `poolKeyHash`
The public key hash of the stake pool to which the stake is being delegated.

type: [`PPubKeyHash`](../PubKey/PPubKeyHash)

## `PoolRegistration`

This certificate is used to register a new stake pool on the Cardano network.

### `poolId`
The public key hash representing the stake pool.

type: [`PPubKeyHash`](../PubKey/PPubKeyHash)

### `poolVRF`
The public key hash representing the stake pool’s VRF (Verifiable Random Function) key, which is used in slot leader election.

type: [`PPubKeyHash`](../PubKey/PPubKeyHash) 

## `PoolRetire`

Used to retire an existing stake pool after a specific epoch

### `poolId`
The public key hash of the stake pool being retired.

type: [`PPubKeyHash`](../PubKey/PPubKeyHash)

### `epoch`
The epoch at which the pool will retire. Once this epoch is reached, the pool is no longer active.

type: [`TermInt`](../../../../stdlib/TermInt)

## `Genesis`

A genesis certificate is used in special cases involving the system’s genesis or bootstrap period.

## `MoveInstantRewards`

A MoveInstantRewards certificate is used to move rewards from the treasury or reserves to specified accounts.
