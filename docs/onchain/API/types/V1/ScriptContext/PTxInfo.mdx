# `PTxInfo`

:::warning
Modified in V2 version
:::

It is the first field of the [`PScriptContext`](./PScriptContext) structure.

It includes all the information regarding the transaction in which the script is included.

definition:

```ts
export const PTxInfo = pstruct({
    PTxInfo: {
        inputs: list( PTxInInfo.type ),
        outputs: list( PTxOut.type ),
        fee:  PValue.type,
        mint: PValue.type,
        dCertificates: list( PDCert.type ),
        withdrawals: list( pair( PStakingCredential.type, int ) ),
        interval: PPOSIXTimeRange.type,
        signatories: list( PPubKeyHash.type ),
        datums: list( pair( PDatumHash.type, data ) ),
        id: PTxId.type
    }
})
```

Values implements all the properties defined on the [`TermList`](../../stdlib/TermList) utility term.

## `inputs`

List of transaction inputs. Each input representing an unspent transaction output (UTXO) consumed by the current transaction.

type: `list( PTxInInfo.type )`

elements's type: [`PTxInInfo`](./PTxInInfo)

## `outputs`

List of transaction outputs. Each output represents a new UTXO created by the transaction.

type: `list( PTxOut.type )`

elements's type: [`PTxOut`](./PTxOut)

## `fee`

Transaction fee paid for processing the transaction.
Despite being only a value it always includes a single entry which represents the lovelaces paid as fees.

type: [`PValue.type`](./PValue)

## `mint`

Includes all tokens minted/burned in the transaction.

type: [`PValue.type`](./PValue)

:::info ADA entry

Being a value directly constructed by the node it always includes an entry for `lovelaces`

Since lovelaces can't be minted/burned the quantity will always be 0
:::


### `dCertificates`

List of delegation certificates included in the transaction.

type: `list( PDCert.type )`

elements's type: [`PDCert`](./PDCert)

### `withdrawals`

A list of withdrawals from staking rewards. Each entry consists of a staking credential and the amount withdrawn.

type: `list( pair( PStakingCredential.type, int ) )`

elements's types: 

- [`PStakingCredential`](./PStakingCredential)
- [`TermInt`](../../stdlib/TermInt)

### `interval`

Time interval during which the transaction is valid.

type: [`PPOSIXTimeRange.type`](./PPOSIXTimeRange)


### `signatories`

type: `list( PPubKeyHash.type )`

elements's type: [`PPubKeyHash`](./PPubKeyHash) 

### `datums`

A list of datums associated with the transaction.
Each datum consists of a datum hash and the actual data, providing additional context or information for the transaction

type: `list( pair( PDatumHash.type, data ) )`

elements's types: 

- [`TermPair`](../../stdlib/TermPair)
- [`PDatumHash`](./PDatumHash)
- `data`

### `id`

The unique identifier of the transaction, used to reference and track the specific transaction on the blockchain.

type: [`PTxId.type`](./PTxId)
