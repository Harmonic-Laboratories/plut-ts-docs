# `PScriptPurpose`

It is the second field of the [`PScriptContext`](./PScriptContext) structure.

It tells us what specific role or purpose the script is used for based on the constructor. It passes some useful information that would be hard to access otherwise.

Definition:

```ts
import { pstruct } from "../../../../PTypes/PStruct/pstruct";
import { PStakingCredential } from "../../Address/PStakingCredential";
import { PDCert } from "../../PDCert";
import { PTxOutRef } from "../../Tx/PTxOutRef";
import { PCurrencySymbol } from "../../Value/PCurrencySymbol";

export const PScriptPurpose = pstruct({
    Minting: { currencySym: PCurrencySymbol.type },
    Spending: { utxoRef: PTxOutRef.type },
    // highlight-start
    Rewarding: { stakeCredential: PStakingCredential.type },
    Certifying: { dCert: PDCert.type }
    // highlight-end
});
```
