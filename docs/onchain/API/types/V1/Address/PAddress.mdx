# `PAddress`

Represents an address which includes both a payment credential and an optional staking credential.

Definition:

```ts
export const PAddress = pstruct({
    PAddress: {
        credential: PCredential.type,
        stakingCredential: PMaybe( PStakingCredential.type ).type
    }
})
```
## `credential`

This field represents the main payment credential used in the address. It can be a public key credential or a script credential, defined by the PCredential type.

type: [`PCredential`](./PCredential)


## `stakingCredential`

This field represents the optional staking credential associated with the address. It uses PMaybe, meaning the staking credential might or might not be present.

type: `PMaybe( PStakingCredential.type ).type`
