# `PChangedParams`

:::info
Introduced in V3 version

This type represents a Plutus `Data` object containing proposed changes to the Cardano protocol parameters. 
It uses a map structure to store only the changed parameters, while unchanged parameters are excluded.

The map must be non-empty. The keys (parameter IDs) are stored in ascending order.

Definition:

```ts
export const PChangedParams = palias( map( data, data ) );
```

aliased type: [`TermBS`](../../../../stdlib/TermBS)
