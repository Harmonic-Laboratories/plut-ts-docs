This structure is part of the system that allows participants to express preferences on proposals, delegating their voting power to different types of DReps.

import { pstruct } from "../../../PTypes/PStruct/pstruct";
import { PCredential } from "../../V1/Address/PCredential";

export const PDrep = pstruct({
    DRep: { credentials: PCredential.type },
    AlwaysAbstain: {},
    AlwaysNoConfidence: {}
});
```
