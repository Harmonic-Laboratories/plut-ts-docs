# `PPOSIXTimeRange` and `PInterval`

used to describe the time interval in which a transaction is considered valid

definition:

```ts
export const PExtended = pstruct({
    PNegInf: {},
    PFinite: { _0: int },
    PPosInf: {}
});

export const PUpperBound = pstruct({
    PUpperBound: {
        bound: PExtended.type,
        inclusive: bool 
    }
});

export const PLowerBound = pstruct({
    PLowerBound: {
        bound: PExtended.type,
        inclusive: bool 
    }
});

export const PInterval = pstruct({
    PInterval: {
        from: PLowerBound.type,
        to: PUpperBound.type
    }
});

export const PPOSIXTimeRange = PInterval;
```

## `PInterval`

### `from`

type: [`PLowerBound`](#plowerbound-and-pupperbound)

###  `to`

type: [`PUpperBound`](#plowerbound-and-pupperbound)


## `PLowerBound` and `PUpperBound`

even if the two have differnet name they are foundamentaly interchangeable
since both have the same strucutre.

### `bound`

type: [`PExtended`](#pextended)

### `inclusive`

type: [`bool`](../../stdlib/TermBool)


## `PExtended`

either an interger or positive/negative infinite representation

### `PNegInf`

### `PFinite`

field type: [`int`](../../stdlib/TermInt)

### `PPosInf`
