# Generic Structs

Sometimes it might be necessary to define custom types that are able to work with any other type; often acting as containers.

A great example are lists; which can work with elements of any type; and for this reason we have `list( int )`, `list( bs )`, etc...

But lists are built into the language; how do we define our own containers?

In the same way we define [generic types](../../Types#plu-ts-generics)!

As we know [structs can have multiple constructors](./structs.md) and the same is true for generic ones; so let's try to define a type that can hold either one or two instances of the same type:

```ts
const POneOrTwo = ( ty ) => pstruct({
    One: { value: ty },
    Two: { fst: ty, snd: ty }
});
```

`pgenericStruct` returns a funciton (and not a class like `pstruct` does) that takes as input as many `TermType`s as in the definition (the arguments of thefunction passed to `pgenericStruct')

and only then returns a class; which represents the actual struct type.
```ts
const OneOrTwoInts = POneOrTwo( int ),

const OneOrTwoBS = POneOrTwo( bs );

const OneOrTwoOneOrTwoInts = POneOrTwo( POneOrTwo( int ).type );
```

:::info make Typescript happy

each time we need to deal with something that is generic Typescript needs a little help understanding
what is the type of the argument.

We can make Typescript happy by making the funciton that returns a struct generic in typescript;

So the correct version of the snipped above would be:
```ts
const POneOrTwo = <TyArg extends TermType>( ty: TyArg ) => 
    pstruct({
        One: { value: ty },
        Two: { fst: ty, snd: ty }
    });
```
