# builtins

Fortunately UPLC does have some basic functions that allow us to build more complex ones when needed.

We already encountered `peqInt` while introducing `plam` exactly because we needed a way to interact with our terms.

The [Plutonomicon open source repository](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-functions.md) has some great docs explaining the behavior of each builtin available.
