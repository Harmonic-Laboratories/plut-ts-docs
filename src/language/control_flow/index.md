# control flow

Every programming language that wants to be turing complete has to include some sort of way to:

- execute code conditionally
- repeat specific parts of the code

To satisfy those requirements, `plu-ts` implements

- [the `if then else` construct](./if_then_else.md)
- [the `pmatch` construct](./pmatch.md)
- [recursive funcitons](./recursion.md)
