`plu-ts` is a strongly typed eDSL for generating Cardano Smart Contracts. 

In order to allow the creation of efficient smart contracts, `plu-ts` is functional, allowing more control over the compiled result.

As a consequence of the functional nature of the language, everything in `plu-ts` is an expression.
